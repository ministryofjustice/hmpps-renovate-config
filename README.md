# HMPPS Renovate Config

Shared configuration for [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com) to be used in HMPPS projects - [find places where folks are using it](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aministryofjustice+hmpps-renovate-config&type=code&ref=advsearch&l=&l=)

For contributions please contact the [#hmpps_dev](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C69NWE339) channel in Slack or raise an issue in this project.

## Steps to setup Renovate

1. Enable Renovate in your project's repository
   - You can request this on #ask-operations-engineering, see [example](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01BUKJSZD4/p1666077244584669)
2. Renovate Bot will automatically create a PR called _Configure Renovate_
3. In that PR update `renovate.json` with the following. Change `node` for other named presets and add any other configuration you like:
   ```json
   {
     "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
     "extends": [
       "github>ministryofjustice/hmpps-renovate-config:node"
     ]
   }
   ```
4. Merge the PR and Renovate is up and running! ðŸŽ‰

You can read more about sharable config presets on the [Renovate docs](https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-presets/)


## Renovate Config

Renovate has a lot of [Configuration Options](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/) and the configuration in this project is relatively light touch to allow teams to setup what works for them.


### Default 'rebaseWhen' rule

We've set the 'rebaseWhen' rule to be 'conflicted' to reduce the amount of CI resource that renovate is using.
If teams aren't regularly merging the PRs renovate generates, they can build up a hefty backlog and a build per open PR is triggered on each merge.

Even a simple attempt to merge 4 Renovate PRs would lead to (1 + 3) + (1 + 2) + (1 + 1) + (1) = 10 builds.
If those 4 PRs were ignored whilst other developer changes go in it would trigger (1 + 4) = 5 builds on each merge.   

This setting will mean that Renovate will only rebase if the file renovate is trying to change becomes conflicted. 
This means teams will have to manually update or re-trigger a branch if it falls behind the main branch and they wish to merge the PR.

This is only a default and can be overriden in individual project configuration but would advise teams not to. 


### Overriding

You can override any of the configuration defined in `base.json` or the other presets by setting them in your repositories `renovate.json`

To help teams see what configuration Renovate is using we have set `"printConfig": true` in `base.json` which logs the full resolved config each of the [GitHub App run logs](https://app.renovatebot.com/dashboard#github/ministryofjustice)

### Grouping by release type, per package manager

To reduce the number of PRs raised teams can use the following the group updates for all minor and patch NPM dependencies:  

```json
"packageRules": [
  {
    "matchManagers": ["npm"],
    "matchUpdateTypes": ["minor", "patch"],
    "groupName": "all non major NPM dependencies",
    "groupSlug": "all-npm-minor-patch"
  }
]
```

You can switch `matchManagers` for any of the other [Renovate Managers](https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/)

### Package stability days

To reduce the noise of PRs being raised as soon as new versions of dependencies are released, teams can configure the stability days, read more on the [Renovate docs](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#stabilitydays)

This is treated as a check in GitHub and works well in conjunction with `"prCreation": "not-pending"` - see [Renovate docs](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#prcreation) for that)

```json
"packageRules": [
  {
    "matchManagers": ["npm"],
    "stabilityDays": 3
  }
]
```

It is possible to override this for dependencies with vulnerability alerts, read more on the [Renovate docs](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#vulnerabilityalerts)

```json
"vulnerabilityAlerts": {
  "stabilityDays": 0
}
```

### Pinning versions

Useful to ensure Renovate does not bump certain dependencies, as you may not wish to use the latest major version. One way of achieving this is using `allowedVersions`, read more on the [Renovate docs](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#allowedversions)

```json
"packageRules": [
  {
    "matchDatasources": ["docker"],
    "allowedVersions": "19-jre-jammy"
  }
]
```

### Assigning reviews

Assigning Renovate PRs to folks can help with visibility to ensure they are approved and merged in a timely manner. Ways to achieve this:
 - If repositories use [GitHub CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) then they can use the config [assigneesFromCodeOwners](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#assigneesfromcodeowners)
 - [reviewers](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#reviewers) however as per [comment on JIRA](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/browse/HEAT-39?focusedCommentId=257543) was not able to get assigning to a GitHub team working, and instead assigned to individuals with `"reviewers": ["neilmendum"]`
